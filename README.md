# front-end-react
A simple React to-do-list project that lives entirely on the front end. For the purpose of tutoring a friend.

Remember, you can't spell 'front end' without 'frend' :)

Based not a little upon [this](http://codepen.io/pankajparashar/pen/MYzgyW?editors=1000#0).

To run:
-----
```
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```

To develop (with automatic building when you save the src file)
-----
```
node_modules/.bin/babel --watch src/listMaker.js --out-file dist/bundle.js
```
